            <h2>The Greek Origins</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Democritus (400 BCE):</strong> Introduced the idea of indivisible particles called "atomos."</li>
                <li><strong>Four Fundamental Substances:</strong> Ancient Greeks believed that all matter was composed of Fire, Earth, Water, and Air.</li>

            <h2>From Alchemy to Chemistry</h2>
            <p>
                During the Middle Ages, alchemists sought to transform base metals into gold and discover the "elixir of life." 
                Their work laid the foundation for modern chemistry.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed early techniques for distillation and filtration.</li>
                <li>Recorded observations systematically, leading to scientific methodologies.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Scientific Revolution</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Robert Boyle (1661):</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Established the scientific method in chemistry.</li>
                        <li>Defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down further.</li>
                        <li>Proposed Boyle’s Law relating pressure and volume.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Antoine Lavoisier (1774):</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Proved the Law of Conservation of Mass: mass is neither created nor destroyed.</li>
                        <li>Disproved the phlogiston theory of combustion.</li>
                        <li>Named oxygen and hydrogen.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>Dalton’s Atomic Theory</h2>
            <p>In 1808, John Dalton developed the first modern atomic theory:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All matter is made up of atoms.</li>
                <li>Atoms of the same element are identical.</li>
                <li>Atoms combine in fixed ratios to form compounds.</li>
                <li>Atoms cannot be created or destroyed in chemical reactions.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Practice Questions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Who is considered the "Father of Modern Chemistry," and what are his contributions?</li>
                <li>Explain the significance of the Law of Conservation of Mass.</li>
                <li>How did Dalton’s Atomic Theory revolutionize the understanding of matter?</li>
            </ol>
